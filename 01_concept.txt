ARPGuard MVP: Final Concept
Purpose
ARPGuard is a desktop tool that empowers users to explore, test, and secure local networks against ARP poisoning. The MVP focuses on three core actions—scanning the network, simulating ARP spoofing, and detecting threats—delivered through a seamless, approachable experience that balances power and simplicity.

Target Users
Ethical Hackers: Need quick setup and precise control for penetration testing.
Network Admins: Seek fast diagnostics and protection for LANs.
Learners: Want clarity and guidance to understand ARP concepts.
Rethinking Usability & UX
Guiding Principles
Clarity: Minimize technical overwhelm with straightforward workflows and contextual help.
Efficiency: Reduce clicks and commands to execute core tasks.
Feedback: Provide real-time, actionable updates so users know what’s happening.
Safety: Emphasize ethical use with clear warnings and consent checkpoints.
Flexibility: Support both novice and advanced users with layered options.
Delivery Format
Hybrid Interface: A lightweight graphical user interface (GUI) with an optional command-line fallback.
Why GUI? Visual feedback (e.g., device maps, alerts) enhances usability over CLI-only, especially for learners and admins needing at-a-glance insights.
Why CLI fallback? Power users (hackers) prefer terminal efficiency and scripting.
Final Features & UX Design
1. Network Scanner
What It Does: Discovers devices on the local network, showing IP and MAC addresses.
UX Approach:
Visual Dashboard: Opens to a clean screen with a “Scan Network” button. Post-scan, displays a dynamic table or network map (nodes) listing devices (e.g., “Router: 192.168.1.1, MAC: 00:14:22:33:44:55”).
User Flow: Click “Scan” → progress bar (e.g., “Scanning 192.168.1.0/24…”) → results in 5-10 seconds.
Usability Boost:
Hover tooltips show device details (e.g., vendor from MAC).
Filter option (e.g., “Show only active devices”).
One-click export to CSV for admins.
Feedback: “Found 8 devices” notification with a timestamp.
2. ARP Spoofing Simulator
What It Does: Lets users spoof a target device’s ARP table to redirect traffic.
UX Approach:
Intuitive Selection: From the scanner’s device list, right-click a device (e.g., router) → “Spoof This” → modal asks, “Spoof as what IP?” (defaults to gateway).
User Flow: Select target → confirm action → “Spoofing Active” status with a stop button.
Usability Boost:
Ethical warning popup: “Only use on networks you own or have permission to test. Continue?” (Yes/No).
Visual cue: Target device node turns red during spoofing.
Progress indicator: “Sent 50 ARP replies” updates in real-time.
Feedback: “Spoofing 192.168.1.1 as 192.168.1.100” with success/failure alerts (e.g., “Target not responding”).
3. ARP Threat Detector
What It Does: Monitors ARP traffic for signs of poisoning (e.g., MAC conflicts).
UX Approach:
Passive Monitoring: “Start Detection” button on the main screen → runs in the background.
User Flow: Click “Detect” → app minimizes to system tray → pops up alerts on threats.
Usability Boost:
Alert system: Red banner or tray notification (e.g., “Conflict detected: 192.168.1.1 has two MACs”).
Simple toggle: “Auto-protect” to lock local ARP table (if supported by OS).
History panel: Shows past alerts with timestamps.
Feedback: “Monitoring active, 0 threats detected” updates periodically.
4. Help & Context
What It Does: Guides users through features and concepts.
UX Approach:
Onboarding: First launch shows a 3-slide tutorial (“Scan → Spoof → Detect”).
Tooltips & Docs: Hover over buttons for quick explanations (e.g., “ARP Spoofing: Tricks devices into sending traffic to you”).
Learn Mode: Toggle to display inline explanations during use (e.g., “Why is this red? Spoofing is active!”).
Usability Boost: One-click link to a “What is ARP?” guide.
Final UI Layout
Main Window:
Top Bar: “Scan Network” | “Start Detection” | “Help” buttons.
Left Panel: Device list or network map (scrollable).
Right Panel: Action controls (e.g., “Spoof” settings, detection status).
Bottom Bar: Status log (e.g., “Last scan: 10:15 AM, Spoofing active”).
Tray Icon: Shows app state (green = idle, yellow = detecting, red = spoofing/threat).
Theme: Dark mode default (easy on eyes for tech users), with light mode option.
Usability Enhancements
Error Handling:
Friendly messages: “No network found. Connect to Wi-Fi or Ethernet” instead of cryptic logs.
Auto-suggest fixes: “Run as admin for full access” if permissions fail.
Customization:
Set scan range (e.g., “192.168.1.0/24”) or use auto-detected subnet.
Adjust spoofing interval (e.g., “Send ARP every 1s, 2s, 5s”).
Accessibility:
High-contrast visuals for readability.
Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+S for scan, Ctrl+D for detect).
Performance:
Lightweight design: Quick load times, minimal CPU use during idle/detection.
Pause/resume for resource-heavy tasks like spoofing.
Final UX Flow Example
User Goal: Test if a network is vulnerable to ARP spoofing.
Steps:
Launch ARPGuard → click “Scan Network” → see 5 devices in 8 seconds.
Right-click router (192.168.1.1) → “Spoof This” → confirm warning → spoofing starts.
Red node appears → “Spoofing Active” shows packets sent.
Click “Stop” → status reverts to green.
Switch to “Detect” → app flags any counterattacks or anomalies.
Tech Stack (No Implementation Details)
Core: Python-based for cross-platform support.
Networking: Library for packet crafting and sniffing (e.g., Scapy).
UI: Lightweight GUI framework (e.g., Tkinter or PyQt) + CLI fallback.
Extras: Basic logging and system tray integration.
Final Deliverable
Name: ARPGuard
MVP Scope: Network scanner, ARP spoofing simulator, threat detector, help system.
UX Highlights: Intuitive dashboard, real-time feedback, ethical safeguards, learner-friendly.
Platform: Desktop (Windows), Python-driven.
