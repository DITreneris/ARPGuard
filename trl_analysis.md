## Overall System TRL: 7

### Justification
ARPGuard is currently at TRL 7 because:
1. All core components have been demonstrated in operational environments
2. The system has been tested in relevant conditions
3. Performance metrics have been validated
4. Security testing has been completed
5. Integration capabilities have been demonstrated

### Path to TRL 9
To achieve TRL 9, ARPGuard needs to:
1. Deploy in multiple production environments
2. Gather long-term operational data
3. Validate performance across different network sizes
4. Complete full compliance certification
5. Document successful deployments

## Key Milestones for TRL Advancement

### To TRL 8
1. Complete enterprise deployment validation
2. Finalize all compliance certifications
3. Document successful integration cases
4. Validate scalability in large networks

### To TRL 9
1. Deploy in multiple enterprise environments
2. Gather 12 months of operational data
3. Document successful threat prevention cases
4. Validate performance in diverse network conditions
5. Complete third-party security audits

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. Scalability in very large networks
2. Integration with legacy systems
3. Performance under extreme conditions

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Continuous performance optimization
2. Enhanced testing in diverse environments
3. Development of scaling solutions
4. Regular security audits

## Conclusion
ARPGuard is currently at TRL 7, with a clear path to TRL 9. The system has demonstrated its capabilities in operational environments, but needs further validation in diverse production settings to reach the highest TRL. The development roadmap and testing procedures are well-defined to support this progression.
