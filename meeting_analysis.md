# Meeting Analysis: Guards & Robbers Project

## Project Overview
The Guards & Robbers project consists of three interconnected components:
1. **ARP Guard** (TRL 7-8)
   - Network protection tool
   - Advanced intrusion detection
   - Highest TRL among components

2. **Evader** (TRL 6)
   - Penetration testing tool
   - Data extraction capabilities
   - Medium TRL level

3. **Marketing Platform** (TRL 5)
   - Client data collection
   - Personalized offer delivery
   - UI optimization capabilities
   - Lowest TRL among components

## Key Discussion Points

### Investor Concerns
1. **Scope Breadth**
   - Project covers multiple domains (security, penetration testing, marketing)
   - FIRSTPICK prefers focused, single-product investments
   - Potential overlap with existing portfolio company (Cyber Upgrade)

2. **Development Resources**
   - Solo developer (Tomas) with consultant support
   - Multiple products at different TRL levels
   - Resource allocation challenges

### Project Strengths
1. **Technical Maturity**
   - ARP Guard at TRL 7-8 (ready for deployment)
   - Clear path to TRL 9 for core components
   - Strong foundation in AI/ML technologies

2. **Market Relevance**
   - Addresses current security challenges
   - Compliance with DORA and EU AI Act
   - Integration with industry standards

## Strategic Recommendations

### Short-term Focus (Next 3 Months)
1. **Concentrate on ARP Guard**
   - Leverage highest TRL (7-8)
   - Complete remaining TRL 8 requirements
   - Prepare for production deployment

2. **Resource Allocation**
   - Prioritize ARP Guard development
   - Maintain Evader at current TRL
   - Consider pausing marketing platform development

### Medium-term Strategy (6-12 Months)
1. **Product Refinement**
   - Achieve TRL 9 for ARP Guard
   - Document successful deployments
   - Gather operational data

2. **Integration Development**
   - Focus on core security features
   - Develop essential integrations
   - Maintain compliance capabilities

### Long-term Vision (12+ Months)
1. **Product Expansion**
   - Revisit Evader development
   - Consider marketing platform integration
   - Evaluate additional features based on market needs

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Resource Constraints**
   - Focus on core product
   - Consider strategic partnerships
   - Prioritize critical features

2. **Market Competition**
   - Differentiate from Cyber Upgrade
   - Focus on unique capabilities
   - Build strong value proposition

### Strategic Risks
1. **Scope Management**
   - Maintain clear product boundaries
   - Document feature priorities
   - Regular scope reviews

2. **Investor Alignment**
   - Align with FIRSTPICK preferences
   - Demonstrate focused value
   - Show clear path to market

## Next Steps
1. Refine ARP Guard focus
2. Develop detailed deployment plan
3. Prepare investor update
4. Document success metrics
5. Establish clear milestones

## Conclusion
The project shows strong technical potential, particularly in the ARP Guard component. The immediate focus should be on bringing ARP Guard to TRL 9 while maintaining a clear, focused product vision that aligns with investor expectations. The development of Evader and the marketing platform should be deprioritized until ARP Guard achieves full market readiness.
