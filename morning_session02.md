## Development Session Completed Successfully
All planned tasks for the morning session and the extended afternoon session have been successfully completed. The ARPGuard CLI implementation for the Demo Tier is now feature-complete and ready for review and deployment. The team has met and exceeded all the defined success criteria.

## Achievements
1. **Complete Demo Tier CLI Implementation**
   - Robust command structure with standardized format
   - Comprehensive help system with detailed examples
   - Colored output and visual enhancements for better user experience
   - Progress indicators and spinners for long-running operations

2. **Core Network Detection Engine**
   - Device discovery with classification functionality
   - ARP cache monitoring with anomaly detection
   - Real-time alert system with severity levels
   - Multiple spoofing attack detection mechanisms

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all components
   - Well-documented code with clear module structure
   - Robust error handling and user feedback
   - Performance considerations for resource usage

4. **User Documentation**
   - Detailed CLI usage documentation
   - Command examples and best practices
   - Troubleshooting guidance
   - Configuration options

## Next Steps
1. **Demo Tier Finalization**
   - Conduct peer code review
   - Perform end-to-end testing
   - Package for distribution
   - Create demo for stakeholders

2. **Prepare for Lite Tier Development**
   - Design basic GUI architecture
   - Plan database integration for persistent data
   - Develop alert notification system

## Notes
- The implementation successfully covers all the requirements for the Demo Tier
- The CLI now provides a robust interface for network scanning and ARP spoofing detection
- The ARP Cache Monitor can detect multiple types of ARP spoofing attacks:
  - Gateway impersonation
  - MAC address flapping
  - MAC address conflicts
  - Gateway MAC changes
- The Device Discovery module provides a clean interface for network scanning
- The test coverage ensures reliability of the implementations
- The CLI formatter provides a user-friendly and visually appealing interface
