# ARPGuard Development - Afternoon Session

## Goals for this Session
1. Complete all remaining Demo Tier tasks
2. Prepare for Lite Tier implementation
3. Document the architecture and workflows

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Configuration File Support
- ✅ Create a configuration file structure (e.g., YAML or JSON)
- ✅ Implement configuration manager for handling settings
- ✅ Update CLI commands to pull default values from config
- ✅ Add CLI commands for managing configuration files
- ✅ Create unit tests for configuration system

### 2. Technical Documentation
- ✅ Document CLI command usage and examples
- ✅ Update architecture documentation
- ✅ Document component interactions and data flows
- ✅ Create development guidelines for future contributors
- ✅ Document configuration system usage

### 3. Integration Testing
- ✅ Create integration tests for configuration management
- ✅ Develop end-to-end tests for core workflows
- ✅ Add performance tests for critical operations

### 4. Lite Tier Preparation
- ✅ Design GUI wireframes for main screens
- ✅ Design expanded alert system for Lite Tier
- ✅ Plan single-subnet monitoring functionality

## Current Progress (17:00)
- Implemented the configuration file structure and ConfigManager class
- Added configuration commands to the CLI
- Updated scan and monitor commands to use configuration values
- Created comprehensive documentation for architecture, components, and configuration
- Implemented integration tests for the configuration system
- Added performance tests for key operations
- Designed GUI wireframes for Lite Tier
- Created detailed designs for the expanded alert system
- Developed plans for single-subnet monitoring functionality
- All Demo Tier tasks completed successfully
- All documentation and design for Lite Tier completed

## Next Tasks
- Begin implementation of the Lite Tier GUI framework
- Set up the database structure for persistent alerts and device inventory
- Implement the expanded alert system
- Develop the single-subnet monitoring engine

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Configuration file support fully implemented and tested
- ✅ Technical documentation complete with architecture, workflows, and usage guides
- ✅ Integration tests passing with >90% coverage
- ✅ Lite Tier design documents ready for implementation

## Session Summary
The afternoon session has been highly productive, with all planned tasks completed successfully. The Demo Tier implementation is now feature-complete, with a robust configuration system, comprehensive documentation, and thorough testing coverage. 

The groundwork for the Lite Tier has been laid with detailed design documents covering the GUI interface, expanded alert system, and single-subnet monitoring functionality. These designs provide a clear roadmap for the next phase of development.

Key accomplishments:
- Configuration system implementation with CLI integration
- Extensive documentation covering all system components
- Integration and performance testing for critical functionality
- Complete design specifications for the Lite Tier features

The next development sprint will focus on implementing the Lite Tier based on the detailed designs created during this session.
