## Running the Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_network_scanner.py
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_network_scanner.py::TestNetworkScanner::test_device_discovery
```

To run tests with coverage report:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=app/components --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Test Environment Setup

Before running the tests, ensure you have installed all required dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also, run the environment check to verify your system is properly configured:

```bash
python tests/check_environment.py
```

## Creating New Tests

When creating new tests, please follow these guidelines:

1. **File naming:** Name test files as `test_*.py`
2. **Class naming:** Name test classes as `Test*`
3. **Method naming:** Name test methods as `test_*`
4. **Documentation:** Add docstrings to all test classes and methods
5. **Mocking:** Use mock objects to isolate components and avoid external dependencies
6. **Fixtures:** Use fixtures for common test setup
7. **Assertions:** Use appropriate assertions for different types of checks

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests

Test individual components in isolation. Mock all dependencies.

### Integration Tests

Test interactions between components. Focus on data flow and communication.

### System Tests

Test complete end-to-end workflows from a user perspective.

### Performance Tests

Test application performance under various conditions and loads.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining UI component tests
2. Implement UI/UX tests
3. Develop performance benchmark tests
4. Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with PyQt5 tests:
- Ensure you have PyQt5 properly installed
- On Windows, verify that Qt DLLs are in the system PATH
- Use the environment check script to verify your setup

For test failures related to mock objects:
- Check that you're correctly specifying the import path for patching
- Verify that mock return values match the expected data structures

## Contributing

When contributing new tests:
1. Follow the existing test structure
2. Ensure all tests pass before submitting
3. Update the test plan document with your progress
4. Focus on thorough but efficient testing
