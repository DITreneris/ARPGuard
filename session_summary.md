## Test Coverage Status

| Component Type | Total Tests | Implemented | Coverage % |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Core Components | 32 | 32 | 100% |
| UI Components | 42 | 33 | 78.6% |
| Intelligence Components | 6 | 6 | 100% |
| Integration Tests | 16 | 16 | 100% |
| System Tests | 15 | 15 | 100% |
| Performance Tests | 12 | 12 | 100% |
| **Total** | **123** | **114** | **92.7%** |

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
1. Complete the remaining UI component tests:
   - AttackView: 3 more tests
   - ThreatIntelligenceView: 4 more tests

2. Memory management optimization for packet capture

3. Enhanced CLI tool capabilities:
   - Local result storage and comparison
   - Attack detection improvements

### Medium-term Tasks
1. Set up continuous integration for tests
2. Release version 0.2 with enhanced UI and core features

## Conclusion

Today's session was highly productive with significant progress in three key areas: testing, performance optimization, and documentation. The application now has a more robust test suite with 92.7% of planned tests implemented, optimized performance for network scanning operations, and comprehensive documentation for users and developers. The ARPGuard project is progressing well toward its version 0.2 release.
