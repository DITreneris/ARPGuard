## Time Allocation
- Priority 1: 1 hour
- Priority 2: 1 hour
- Priority 3: 1 hour
- Priority 4: 30 minutes
- Priority 5: 30 minutes

## Success Criteria
1. Demo package can be installed and run in under 15 minutes
2. Dashboard shows real-time network visualization
3. Attack simulation demonstrates core detection capabilities
4. Documentation is clear and comprehensive
5. Test framework validates all demo features

## Risk Mitigation
- Regular commits to prevent code loss
- Frequent testing to catch issues early
- Documentation updates with each feature
- Backup of demo environment configuration

## Next Steps
1. Begin with Priority 1 tasks
2. Move to Priority 2 once core package is functional
3. Implement Priority 3 in parallel with dashboard
4. Document as features are completed
5. Test each component as it's developed
