## ML Module Monitoring System

To effectively track these KPIs, we will implement an ML monitoring system with the following components:

1. **Development Tracking Dashboard**
   - Component completion status
   - Test coverage visualization
   - Documentation progress
   - Milestone tracking

2. **Model Performance Monitoring**
   - Real-time accuracy metrics
   - False positive tracking
   - Performance regression detection
   - A/B testing results

3. **Resource Utilization Monitoring**
   - Memory usage tracking
   - CPU utilization
   - Inference latency monitoring
   - Training resource tracking

4. **Operational Health Metrics**
   - Model serving status
   - Integration health checks
   - API response times
   - Error rates and exceptions
