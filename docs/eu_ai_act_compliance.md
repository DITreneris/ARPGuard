# ARPGuard EU AI Act Compliance Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines ARPGuard's approach to compliance with the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act). As a cybersecurity tool that employs machine learning for anomaly detection and ARP spoofing identification, ARPGuard falls under the purview of this regulation. This document serves as a technical guide for understanding the AI components within ARPGuard and how they align with EU AI Act requirements.

## 1. AI System Classification

### 1.1 System Purpose and Function

ARPGuard employs artificial intelligence for the following purposes:
- Detection of anomalous network behavior
- Identification of ARP spoofing attacks
- Classification of attack severity
- Prediction of potential attack vectors

### 1.2 Risk Classification

Under the EU AI Act classification system, ARPGuard's AI components are classified as a **Limited Risk AI System** because:

1. It does not fall into the prohibited AI practices (Article 5)
2. It is not a high-risk system as defined in Annex III
3. It employs transparency measures to inform users when AI is making decisions
