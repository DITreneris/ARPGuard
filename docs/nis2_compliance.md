# ARPGuard NIS2 Directive Compliance Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines ARPGuard's approach to compliance with the Network and Information Systems (NIS2) Directive. As a cybersecurity tool designed to protect against ARP spoofing attacks, ARPGuard plays a critical role in helping organizations meet their NIS2 obligations. This document details how ARPGuard's features align with NIS2 requirements and how organizations can leverage ARPGuard in their compliance strategy.

## 1. NIS2 Directive Overview

The NIS2 Directive (Directive (EU) 2022/2555) is the updated version of the original NIS Directive and aims to strengthen cybersecurity across the European Union. It applies to a broader range of entities, categorized as "essential" and "important" entities, and imposes more stringent cybersecurity risk management measures, reporting obligations, and enforcement requirements.

### 1.1 Key NIS2 Obligations

Organizations subject to NIS2 must:

1. Implement appropriate and proportionate technical, operational, and organizational measures to manage cybersecurity risks
2. Take appropriate measures to prevent and minimize the impact of incidents
3. Implement business continuity practices such as backup management and disaster recovery
4. Ensure the security of network and information systems, including supply chain security
5. Report significant incidents to competent authorities
6. Apply security policies for human resources and asset management
7. Use encryption and multi-factor authentication where appropriate
8. Implement effective cybersecurity risk management practices
