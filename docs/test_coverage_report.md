## Issues and Gaps

### Current Test Coverage Gaps

1. **AttackView Component (50% Coverage)**
   - Missing tests for mitigation action triggering
   - Missing tests for attack history display
   - Missing tests for evidence collection visualization

2. **ThreatIntelligenceView Component (42.9% Coverage)**
   - Missing tests for threat intelligence data display
   - Missing tests for threat intelligence refresh
   - Missing tests for threat exporting
   - Missing tests for category filtering

3. **PacketAnalyzer (84.7% Line Coverage)**
   - Limited testing of advanced protocol parsing
   - Missing edge case tests for malformed packets
   - Insufficient testing of high-volume packet handling

### High-Priority Test Improvements

1. Complete AttackView component tests with focus on:
   - Evidence view interactions
   - Attack timeline visualization
   - Mitigation workflows

2. Enhance ThreatIntelligenceView tests for:
   - Data refresh mechanisms
   - Filter combinations
   - Export functionality
   - Source filtering

3. Improve performance test coverage for:
   - Large network scanning (>1000 devices)
   - Sustained high-volume packet capture
   - Memory usage under extended operation

## Test Plan Updates

### Short-term Goals (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Complete UI Component Testing**
   - Implement missing tests for AttackView (3 tests)
   - Implement missing tests for ThreatIntelligenceView (4 tests)
   - Verify all UI component tests work with application changes

2. **Performance Test Enhancements**
   - Add memory profiling to packet capture tests
   - Add tests for batch processing of large networks
   - Measure UI responsiveness during intensive operations

3. **CI Pipeline Improvements**
   - Add code coverage reporting to CI pipeline
   - Implement automated test result trending
   - Add visual regression testing for UI components

### Long-term Goals (Next 3 Months)

1. **Test Automation Expansion**
   - Increase automated UI testing coverage to >90%
   - Implement automated load testing for network operations
   - Create automated user workflow testing

2. **Quality Metrics Enhancement**
   - Implement cyclomatic complexity reporting
   - Add security scanning to test pipeline
   - Implement performance regression detection

3. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - Create comprehensive test case documentation
   - Implement automated test coverage reporting
   - Develop executive test summary dashboards

## Conclusion

The ARPGuard application maintains a strong overall test coverage of 92.7% for test implementation and 86.3% for code coverage. Core components are thoroughly tested with 100% test implementation, while UI components have room for improvement at 78.6% implementation.

Current focus should be on completing the missing UI component tests, particularly for AttackView and ThreatIntelligenceView components, which will bring the application closer to the target of >90% overall coverage.

Performance testing is comprehensive but can be enhanced with additional memory and scaling tests. The continuous integration pipeline shows stable builds with consistent test passing rates.
