# ARPGuard Development - Morning Session Plan

## Session Overview
**Date:** 2023-04-22  
**Duration:** 3 hours (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)  
**Focus:** API Security & Client Integration  
**Current Progress:** 85% test coverage, 90% API endpoint coverage, 80% client example coverage

## Session Goals
1. Implement token-based rate limiting
2. Begin client examples for PHP and TypeScript
3. Document version compatibility matrix

## Priority Tasks

### 1. Token-Based Rate Limiting Implementation
*Estimated time: 90 minutes*  
*Priority: High*  
*Dependency: API Versioning (Completed)*

#### Sub-tasks:
1. **Research & Design (15 min)**
   - Review existing rate limiting implementation
   - Document token-based approach requirements
   - Define token allocation and refresh strategy

2. **Core Implementation (45 min)**
   - Create token bucket implementation
   - Implement token refresh mechanism
   - Add configurable limits per endpoint

3. **Integration (20 min)**
   - Connect to existing middleware
   - Add token tracking to user sessions
   - Implement burst handling

4. **Testing (10 min)**
   - Write unit tests for token allocation
   - Test rate limit behavior under load
   - Verify headers and response codes

### 2. Client Example Development
*Estimated time: 60 minutes*  
*Priority: High*  
*Dependency: None*

#### Sub-tasks:
1. **PHP Client (30 min)**
   - Create basic authentication flow
   - Implement API resource access
   - Add error handling and rate limit awareness
   - Document usage with examples

2. **TypeScript Client (30 min)**
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for API responses
   - Implement authentication and token management
   - Add typed API resource methods
   - Include version header handling

### 3. Version Compatibility Matrix Documentation
*Estimated time: 30 minutes*  
*Priority: Medium*  
*Dependency: Version Migration Paths (Completed)*

#### Sub-tasks:
1. **Document Feature Support (15 min)**
   - Create comprehensive feature list
   - Mark compatibility across API versions
   - Highlight deprecated features

2. **Document Breaking Changes (15 min)**
   - List all breaking changes between versions
   - Provide migration examples for each change
   - Include best practices for version migration

## Success Criteria
- [  ] Token-based rate limiting implemented and passing tests
- [  ] PHP client example completed with documentation
- [  ] TypeScript client example completed with documentation
- [  ] Version compatibility matrix documented

## Remaining High-Priority Items for Next Session
- Complete remaining client examples (Swift, Kotlin)
- Add real-time monitoring tests
- Implement configuration templates

## Notes & Guidelines
- Focus on one task at a time
- Take a 5-minute break every 45 minutes
- Document any new issues or edge cases as they are found
- Update the performance metrics at the end of the session
- If you complete all tasks early, begin implementing Swift client example

## Resources Needed
- API documentation for reference
- Existing client examples in other languages
- Rate limiting standards documentation
- Version migration documentation

## Post-Session Actions
- Update session notes with completed tasks
- Create pull requests for new features
- Report progress to the team
- Plan afternoon session priorities
