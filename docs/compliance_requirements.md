## 2. EU AI Act Requirements

While ARPGuard's primary function is network security, its use of machine learning algorithms for attack detection brings it under certain provisions of the EU AI Act.

### Key Requirements for ARPGuard

#### 2.1 Risk Classification

ARPGuard's AI components are likely classified as **Limited Risk AI Systems** as they:
- Do not pose a significant risk to safety, health, or fundamental rights
- Are used for cybersecurity purposes
- Include transparency requirements

#### 2.2 Transparency Requirements

ARPGuard must provide:
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation of AI/ML algorithms used for attack detection
- **User Notification**: Clear indication when AI-based detection is active
- **Decision Explanation**: Ability to explain why specific traffic was flagged as malicious
- **Human Oversight**: Options for human review of AI decisions

#### 2.3 Data Governance

ARPGuard must implement:
- **Data Quality Measures**: Ensure training data is representative and free from biases
- **Technical Documentation**: Document data collection and usage for AI training
- **Training Data Management**: Proper management of data used to train detection algorithms
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data for the functioning of the AI system

#### 2.4 Record-Keeping

ARPGuard must maintain:
- **System Logs**: Detailed logs of AI system operation and decisions
- **Training Records**: Documentation of AI model training and validation
- **Performance Metrics**: Records of false positives/negatives and detection accuracy
- **Version Control**: Records of AI model versions and updates

### EU AI Act Compliance Checklist

| Requirement | ARPGuard Feature | Implementation Status | Documentation Status |

| Risk Classification Documentation | AI/ML Architecture | To be implemented | To be documented |
| Transparency Measures | ML Detection Indicators | To be implemented | To be documented |
| Decision Explanation | Alert Reasoning | Partial | To be documented |
| Human Oversight | Manual Review Tools | Implemented | To be documented |
| Data Governance | Training Data Management | Partial | To be documented |
| Record-Keeping | AI Decision Logs | Implemented | To be documented |

## 3. NIS2 Directive Requirements

The NIS2 Directive strengthens cybersecurity requirements for critical infrastructure and essential service providers across the EU.

### Key Requirements for ARPGuard

- **Impact Assessment**: Tools to assess the impact of security incidents
- **Reporting Templates**: Standardized reporting formats for compliance

#### 3.3 Security Measures

ARPGuard must implement:
- **Network Security**: Robust protection against network-level attacks
- **Access Controls**: Proper authentication and authorization for administrative access
- **Encryption**: Secure communications for management traffic
