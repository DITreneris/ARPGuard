# ARPGuard Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the ARPGuard architecture, including component organization, data flow, and design patterns.

## System Architecture

ARPGuard follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between components. The application is organized into several key layers:

1. **Core Components**: Fundamental network security and analysis functionality
2. **UI Components**: User interface elements for visualization and interaction
3. **Utility Modules**: Common functionality shared across the application
4. **Storage**: Persistence of settings, scanned data, and security events

## Core Components

### Component Relationships

The core components form the foundation of ARPGuard's functionality and interact closely with each other:

```

- Manages static ARP entries
- Supports traffic filtering rules
- Provides blocking mechanisms
- Monitors defense effectiveness

## UI Components

The UI layer presents information to the user and allows interaction with the core functionality. It follows the Model-View pattern, separating data models from their visual representation.

### Key UI Components

- **MainWindow**: Primary application window and container
- **PacketView**: Displays and filters captured packets
- **AttackView**: Shows detected attack patterns
- **NetworkTopologyView**: Visualizes network layout and relationships
- **VulnerabilityView**: Displays detected vulnerabilities
- **ThreatIntelligenceView**: Shows threat intelligence data
- **DefenseView**: Manages defense mechanisms
- **ReportViewer**: Generates and displays reports
- **SessionHistoryView**: Manages historical sessions

### UI Design Principles

The UI follows these key design principles:

1. **Separation of concerns**: UI components don't implement business logic
2. **Event-driven communication**: Components communicate via events/signals
3. **Lazy initialization**: Features load on demand for better performance
4. **Responsive updates**: Background operations don't block the UI
5. **Consistent styling**: Unified visual language across components

## Utility Modules

Utility modules provide common functionality used throughout the application:

### Key Utilities

- **Config**: Configuration management and persistence
- **Logger**: Application-wide logging system
- **Database**: Data storage and retrieval
- **MacVendor**: MAC address to vendor name resolution
- **Icons**: Application iconography
- **Dashboard Improvements**: Reusable dashboard components
- **Reporting Improvements**: Report generation utilities

## Data Flow

### Scanning and Detection Process

1. **NetworkScanner** discovers devices on the local network
2. Device information is stored in the database
3. **PacketAnalyzer** captures network traffic
4. Packets are analyzed by **ThreatDetector** and **AttackRecognizer**
5. **ThreatIntelligence** enhances detection with external data
6. Alerts are generated for suspicious activity
7. **DefenseMechanism** activates appropriate countermeasures
8. Results are displayed in the UI and stored for reporting

### Data Persistence

ARPGuard stores several types of data:

1. **Configuration**: User preferences and settings
2. **Scan Results**: Discovered network devices
3. **Packet Captures**: Network traffic data
4. **Security Events**: Detected threats and attacks
5. **Vulnerabilities**: Identified security weaknesses
6. **Defense History**: Applied defense mechanisms
7. **Reports**: Generated security reports

## Design Patterns

ARPGuard implements several common design patterns:

### Observer Pattern
Used for event notification between components. Components register callbacks to receive notifications when relevant events occur.

Example: UI components register callbacks with core components to receive updates.

### Singleton Pattern
Used for components that should have only one instance throughout the application.

Example: Configuration and logging are implemented as singletons.

### Factory Pattern
Used to create complex objects without exposing creation logic.

Example: The threat intelligence module uses factories to create different types of threat indicators.

### Command Pattern
Used to encapsulate operations as objects.

Example: Defense mechanisms implement commands that can be executed, undone, and tracked.

### Strategy Pattern
Used to select an algorithm at runtime.

Example: Attack recognition uses different detection strategies based on attack type.

## Threading Model

ARPGuard uses a multi-threaded architecture to maintain UI responsiveness:

1. **Main Thread**: UI rendering and event handling
2. **Scanner Thread**: Network device discovery
3. **Packet Capture Thread**: Network traffic capture
4. **Analysis Thread**: Packet and threat analysis
5. **Update Thread**: Threat intelligence updates
6. **Defense Thread**: Executing defense mechanisms

Threads communicate via thread-safe mechanisms like signals and queues.

## Error Handling

ARPGuard implements a robust error handling strategy:

1. **Exception Handling**: All operations have appropriate try/except blocks
2. **Logging**: Errors are logged with context information
3. **User Feedback**: Critical errors are displayed to the user
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Failure in one component doesn't crash the application
5. **Self-Recovery**: Components attempt to recover from error states

## Security Considerations

As a security tool, ARPGuard follows these security principles:

1. **Least Privilege**: Operations run with minimum required permissions
2. **Data Protection**: Sensitive data is handled securely
3. **Input Validation**: All user and network inputs are validated
4. **Secure Defaults**: Default configurations prioritize security
5. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security measures protect each component

## Extensibility

ARPGuard is designed to be extensible in several ways:

1. **Plugin Architecture**: Core components can be extended with plugins
2. **Custom Detection Rules**: Users can define custom attack patterns
3. **API Integration**: External tools can integrate via the API
4. **Custom Reporting**: Report formats and content are customizable
5. **Theme Support**: UI appearance can be customized

## Performance Considerations

ARPGuard optimizes performance through:

1. **Efficient Scanning**: Batch processing and prioritization
2. **Packet Filtering**: Capturing only relevant packets
3. **Caching**: Frequently used data is cached
4. **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
5. **Resource Limits**: Configurable limits on resource usage

## Future Architecture Directions

Planned architectural improvements include:

1. **Microservices**: Split functionality into separate services
2. **Cloud Integration**: Enhanced cloud-based threat intelligence
3. **Machine Learning**: Automated pattern recognition
4. **Distributed Scanning**: Coordinated scanning across multiple devices
5. **Real-time Visualization**: Enhanced network visualization
6. **Blockchain Integration**: Immutable security event logging
