### Core Component Implementation Details

#### Feature Flag System
For the tiered functionality implementation, developers should use the following pattern:

```python
# Feature flag management (example)
class FeatureManager:
    def __init__(self, tier="demo"):
        self.tier = tier
        self.tier_levels = {
            "demo": 0,
            "lite": 1,
            "pro": 2,
            "enterprise": 3
        }
        self.feature_requirements = {
            "gui_access": 1,            # Lite+
            "real_time_monitoring": 1,  # Lite+
            "multi_subnet": 2,          # Pro+
            "machine_learning": 2,      # Pro+
            "threat_intel": 2,          # Pro+
            "rbac": 3,                  # Enterprise only
            "siem_integration": 3       # Enterprise only
        }
    
    def has_feature(self, feature_name):
        if feature_name not in self.feature_requirements:
            return False
        
        required_tier = self.feature_requirements[feature_name]
        current_tier = self.tier_levels.get(self.tier, 0)
        
        return current_tier >= required_tier
```

Usage in code:
```python
# Example usage in packet analyzer
def analyze_packet(packet, feature_manager):
    # Basic analysis available to all tiers
    basic_result = perform_basic_analysis(packet)
    
    # Advanced ML only for Pro and Enterprise tiers
    if feature_manager.has_feature("machine_learning"):
        ml_result = perform_ml_analysis(packet)
        return {**basic_result, **ml_result}
    
    return basic_result
```

#### Modular Architecture

Structure the codebase to support the tiered approach with these module boundaries:

1. **Core Engine** (All Tiers)
   - Packet capture (app/core/packet_capture.py)
   - ARP analysis (app/core/arp_analyzer.py)
   - Network discovery (app/core/network_discovery.py)
   - Basic detection rules (app/core/rules/*.py)

2. **Visualization Layer** (Lite+)
   - Dashboard framework (app/ui/dashboard.py)
   - Chart components (app/ui/components/charts/*.py)
   - Alert visualization (app/ui/components/alerts.py)
   - Report generation (app/reports/*.py)

3. **Intelligence Layer** (Pro+)
   - ML detection pipeline (app/ml/pipeline.py)
   - Threat feed integration (app/threat_intel/*.py)
   - Pattern analysis (app/ml/pattern_analysis.py)
   - Anomaly detection (app/ml/anomaly_detection.py)

4. **Enterprise Layer** (Enterprise)
   - Controller architecture (app/controller/*.py)
   - Agent management (app/agent/*.py)
   - Integration framework (app/integrations/*.py)
   - RBAC system (app/rbac/*.py)

### Database Implementation

Implementation guidelines for database schema evolution across tiers:

1. **Demo Tier**: Simple SQLite with basic tables
   ```sql
   -- devices table
   CREATE TABLE devices (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       mac_address TEXT NOT NULL,
       ip_address TEXT NOT NULL,
       hostname TEXT,
       device_type TEXT,
       last_seen TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   
   -- arp_events table
   CREATE TABLE arp_events (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       device_id INTEGER,
       event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
       timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       details TEXT,
       FOREIGN KEY (device_id) REFERENCES devices(id)
   );
   ```

2. **Lite Tier**: Add alert tables and monitoring tables
   ```sql
   -- alerts table
   CREATE TABLE alerts (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       severity TEXT NOT NULL,
       source_device_id INTEGER,
       description TEXT NOT NULL,
       timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       acknowledged BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
       FOREIGN KEY (source_device_id) REFERENCES devices(id)
   );
   
   -- port_scan_results table
   CREATE TABLE port_scan_results (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       device_id INTEGER,
       port INTEGER NOT NULL,
       protocol TEXT NOT NULL,
       status TEXT NOT NULL,
       service TEXT,
       timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       FOREIGN KEY (device_id) REFERENCES devices(id)
   );
   ```

3. **Pro Tier**: Migration to PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB, implementing time-series and ML storage
   ```sql
   -- Create hypertable for metrics
   CREATE TABLE metrics (
       time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
       device_id INTEGER,
       metric_name TEXT NOT NULL,
       value DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL
   );
   SELECT create_hypertable('metrics', 'time');
   
   -- ML results storage
   CREATE TABLE ml_detections (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
       source_device_id INTEGER,
       target_device_id INTEGER,
       confidence FLOAT NOT NULL,
       detection_type TEXT NOT NULL,
       feature_data JSONB,
       model_version TEXT NOT NULL
   );
   ```

### API Development Approach

Developers should implement APIs incrementally following this pattern:

1. **Internal API Example** (Core functionality)
   ```python
   # In app/api/core.py
   from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
   
   router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/core", tags=["core"])
   
   @router.get("/devices")
   async def get_devices(limit: int = 100, feature_manager=Depends(get_feature_manager)):
       """Get list of discovered devices."""
       devices = await repository.get_devices(limit=limit)
       return {"devices": devices}
   
   @router.get("/scan")
   async def start_scan(subnet: str, feature_manager=Depends(get_feature_manager)):
       """Start network scan on specified subnet."""
       # Check tier permissions
       if subnet != "local" and not feature_manager.has_feature("multi_subnet"):
           raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Multi-subnet scanning requires Pro tier")
           
       scan_id = await scanner.start_scan(subnet)
       return {"scan_id": scan_id}
   ```

2. **Integration API Example** (Enterprise tier)
   ```python
   # In app/api/integrations/siem.py
   from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
   
   router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/integrations/siem", tags=["integrations"])
   
   @router.post("/webhook")
   async def configure_webhook(
       config: WebhookConfig, 
       feature_manager=Depends(get_feature_manager)
   ):
       """Configure webhook integration for alerts."""
       if not feature_manager.has_feature("siem_integration"):
           raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="SIEM integration requires Enterprise tier")
       
       webhook_id = await integration_service.add_webhook(config)
       return {"webhook_id": webhook_id}
   ```

### Testing Strategy Details

Implement test coverage for each tier as follows:

```python
# Example test for Demo tier CLI functionality
# tests/cli/test_commands.py
def test_scan_command():
    """Test the scan command functionality."""
    runner = CliRunner()
    result = runner.invoke(cli, ["scan", "--subnet", "192.168.1.0/24"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "Scanning 192.168.1.0/24" in result.output
    assert "Found" in result.output

# Example test for Lite tier alert functionality
# tests/alerts/test_email_alerts.py
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_email_alerts():
    """Test email alert delivery."""
    alert = Alert(
        severity="high",
        description="Suspicious ARP activity detected",
        device_id=1
    )
    
    with mock_smtp_server() as server:
        await alert_service.send_email_alert(alert, "admin@example.com")
        assert server.received_emails == 1
        email = server.emails[0]
        assert "Suspicious ARP activity" in email.subject
```
